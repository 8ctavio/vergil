# `ModelGroup`

> Creates a collection of component models.

:::tip
Before proceeding with `ModelGroup`, learn first about the [`useModel`](/composables/useModel) composable.
:::

## Usage

```vue
<script setup>
import { ModelGroup } from '@8ctavio/vergil'

const modelGroup = new ModelGroup({
	username: { value: '' },
	password: { value: '' }
})
</script>

<template>
	<InputText v-model="modelGroup.username"/>
	<InputText v-model="modelGroup.password" type="password"/>
</template>
```

## Description

The `ModelGroup` class creates an object of component models that allows to perform bulk operations with them. The `ModelGroup`'s constructor accepts two parameters: `fields` and `validator`.

The `fields` parameter expects an object whose own enumerable string-keyed properties are mapped into the `ModelGroup`'s created object instance as model objects with the same property names. The `fields` property values must be *model specification objects* which are internally used to create corresponding models with the [`useModel`](/composables/useModel) composable; a model specification object's `value` property and the rest of the properties are used, respectively, as the `useModel`'s `value` and `options` parameters. Therefore, in general, an specification object of the form `{ value, ...options }` is transformed into the model `useModel(value, options)`.

```js
new ModelGroup({
	model: { value, ...options } // â†¦ useModel(value, options)
})
```

The `validator` parameter is a function, similar to that of a model, but here used to validate a [ModelGroup's payload](#modelgroup-getpayload) (see [Model group validation](#model-group-validation)).

### Nested model groups

A ModelGroup may be nested into another ModelGroup. The `ModelGroup`'s `fields` parameter, however, does not directly accept `ModelGroup` object instances. In order to nest a ModelGroup, a `fields` property value must be an object returned by the `ModelGroup.nested` static method. This method's parameters are the same as the `ModelGroup` constructor's, but returns an special object internally handled and used to create a corresponding `ModelGroup` object instance.

```js
const group = new ModelGroup({
	foo: { /* ... */ },
	bar: ModelGroup.nested({
		baz: { /* ... */ },
	})
})

console.log(isModel(group.foo))					// true
console.log(group.bar instanceof ModelGroup)	// true
console.log(isModel(group.bar.baz))				// true
```

### Model group validation

The `ModelGroup`'s constructor accepts as a second argument a `validator` function to validate a [ModelGroup's payload](#modelgroup-getpayload), and which is invoked by the [`validate`](#modelgroup-validate) method after all ModelGroup descendants are validated.

A ModelGroup's `validator` function accepts three parameters:

- `payload`: The ModelGroup's `payload` to validate.
- `error`: A function to register validation errors; it receives two arguments: `path` and `message`, where `path` is the ModelGroup's dot-notation path string to the nested model on which to register the error, and `message` is the error message string.
- `isValid`: A function to determine if a nested model has collected any errors up to that moment. It receives as a single argument a ModelGroup's dot-notation path string to the model to inspect.

To illustrate, consider the example below. If `testFoo` returns `true`, the `group.foo` model will have a new error registered. On the other hand, the `group.bar.baz` model is further validated only if it has had no errors registered (e.g., in the model's validator).

```js
const group = new ModelGroup({
	foo: { /* ... */ },
	bar: ModelGroup.nested({
		baz: { /* ... */ },
	})
}, groupValidator)

function groupValidator(payload, error, isValid) {
    if (testFoo(payload.foo)) {
        error('foo', 'Error Foo')
    }
    if (isValid('bar.baz') && testBaz(payload.bar.baz)) {
        error('bar.baz', 'Error Bar-Baz')
    }
}
```

:::warning
ModelGroup nested models' values should not be mutated inside that ModelGroup's validator.
:::

### `modelGroup.reset`

The `reset` method recursively resets all ModelGroup's models.

### `modelGroup.getPayload`

The `getPayload` method creates and returns a ModelGroup's *payload*, which is an object of the same structure as the ModelGroup's, but whose own property values store either the model-values of the corresponding ModelGroup's models, or the payloads of the corresponding nested ModelGroups.

```js
const group = new ModelGroup({
	foo: { value: 1 },
	bar: ModelGroup.nested({
		baz: { value: 2 },
	})
})

console.log(group.getPayload())
// {
//     foo: 1,
//     bar: { baz: 2 }
// }
```

### `modelGroup.validate`

The `validate` method recursively validates all ModelGroup's models. If the ModelGroup was created with a `validator` function, it is executed after descendants are validated.

By default, `validate` returns a boolean indicating whether all ModelGroup's descendant models are valid, i.e., none have any errors.

In addition, `validate` accepts an `includePayload` boolean parameter that defaults to `false`. When `includePayload` is set to `true`, a two-element array is returned instead, where the first element is the normally returned, validation result boolean, and the second element is the [ModelGroup's payload](#modelgroup-getpayload).

```js
const isValid = modelGroup.validate()
// or...
const [isValid, payload] = modelGroup.validate(true)
```

### `modelGroup.clear`

The `clear` method recursively clears errors of all ModelGroup's models.

### `modelGroup.error`

The `error` property is a trackable, readonly accessor property that returns a boolean indicating whether any ModelGroup's nested model has errors.

### `modelGroup.forErrors`

The `forErrors` method allows to recursively iterate over all model errors in a ModelGroup. It receives as its first argument a `callback` function executed for each nested model with errors. The callback receives four arguments: 

- `errors`: the current model's errors array,
- `field`: the property name the current model is stored at in its owner ModelGroup object,
- `path`: a dot-separated property name list that represents the current model's location or path within its root ModelGroup object, and
- `model`: the current model object.

Additionally, `forErrors` accepts as a second argument a `filter` function to exclude models from the iteration. This function is called for both model and model group objects, and receives four arguments:

- `actions`: An object whose properties should be returned by `filter` to handle how to filter the current model or model group; available properties are `SKIP`, `ACCEPT`, `ACCEPT_CHILDREN`, and `ACCEPT_DESCENDANTS` (detailed below),
- `path`: the current model or model group's path from its root ModelGroup object as a dot-separated property name list,
- `isGroup`: a boolean indicating whether the value at the given path is a `ModelGroup` object instance, and
- `value`: the current model or model group object.

The type of object passed to, and the value returned by the `filter` function determine how a model or model group is filtered. If a model is received, either `actions.SKIP` or `actions.ACCEPT` should be returned to respectively skip or include a model in the `forErrors` iteration. On the other hand, when `filter` is passed a ModelGroup object, multiple descendant models may be affected by the returned `actions` property:

- `SKIP`: All ModelGroup's descendant models are excluded from the iteration (this implies that no ModelGroup's nested object is further passed to `filter`).
- `ACCEPT`: All ModelGroup's child objects continue to be passed to `filter`. 
- `ACCEPT_CHILDREN`: All ModelGroup's child models are included in the iteration (only child ModelGroups continue to be passed to `filter`).
- `ACCEPT_DESCENDANTS`: All ModelGroup's descendant models are included in the iteration (no ModelGroup's descendant object is further passed to `filter`).

:::tip
When `forErrors` is called, `errors` refs of models included in the iteration can be tracked by effects.
