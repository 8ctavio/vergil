# `useDefineModel`

> Defines a bidirectional model-value bond between a (provided) model and a component, and creates a model wrapper with additional utilities to separately handle internal and external model value mutations.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup>
defineProps({
	modelValue: {
		type: [ModelValueType, Object],
		default: defaultModelValue
	},
	['onUpdate:modelValue']: Function,
	validator: Function
})

const model = useDefineModel()
</script>
```

## Description

The `useDefineModel` composable is analogous to the `defineModel` macro in that it creates an object to conveniently interact with component props to establish a model-component bond through the model's value.

However, `useDefineModel` is primarly designed to support *component model objects* created by the [`useModel`](/composables/useModel) composable and received through the `model-value` prop. Thus, the recommended approach to bind a model with a component implementing `useDefineModel` is by providing a model object via the `v-model` directive. Nevertheless, `useDefineModel` still supports for regular refs to instead be provided through `v-model`.

The `useDefineModel` composable accepts as a single argument an `options` object (see [Parameters](#parameters)) and returns a *wrapped* version of a provided model, which has access to the regular model properties and includes additional methods to [separately handle internal and external model value updates](#handle-internal-and-external-model-value-updates). If, however, a model is not provided, `useDefineModel` creates one internally with a `validator` function taken from the component's `validator` prop to support [model-value validation](/composables/useModel#validation-and-error-handling).

:::warning
A model wrapper returned by `useDefineModel` is still an [extendedRef](/reactivity/extendedRef). See [Difference with ref](/reactivity/extendedRef#difference-with-ref) to learn the main pragmatic differences with regular refs.
:::

:::tip NOTE
Components implementing `useDefineModel` need to manually define the `modelValue`, `onUpdate:modelValue`, and `validator` props.
:::

:::info
For brevity, custom components that implement `useDefineModel` to support bidirectional model-value binding will be referred to as **Form Field Components (FFC)**.
:::

### Nesting models

Some FFC implementations may require to share their underlying model object with other nested FFCs. In order to further pass models down an FFC tree, model wrappers created by `useDefineModel` should be directly provided through the `model-value` prop of child FFCs. `useDefineModel` is able to properly identify and handle provided model wrappers.

```vue
<!-- Root -->
<script setup>
defineProps(/* ... */)
const model = useDefineModel()
</script>

<template>
	<!-- Directly provide model wrapper -->
	<Nested :model-value="model"/>
</template>
```

### Handle internal and external model value updates

The `useDefineModel`'s API allows to separately handle internal and external model value updates. Here, internal and external refer to *where*, in relation to an FFC's context/scope, is a model-value update performed. Three types of model value updates are considered:

- **Local**: Updates performed *within* an FFC's own scope.
- **Internal**: Updates performed in any *nested* FFC.
- **External**: Updates performed anywhere *outside* an FFC's scope; in particular: in ancestor, sibling, or sibling's descendant scopes.

:::tip
To illustrate, consider the following component tree where all components have access to the same model. The type of update `Reference` would perceive when a given component updates the model value is hinted in parenthesis.

<Demo>
	<Anatomy tag="App (external)">
		<Anatomy tag="Root (external)">
			<Anatomy tag="Reference (local)">
				<Anatomy tag="Nested (internal)"/>
			</Anatomy>
			<Anatomy tag="Sibling (external)">
				<Anatomy tag="Nested (external)"/>
			</Anatomy>
		</Anatomy>
	</Anatomy>
</Demo>
:::

The following two requirements must be met for FFCs to properly identify model value update types:

1. In order to share an FFC's underlying model with other child FFCs, child components must be provided with the parent component's model wrapper created by `useDefineModel` (see [Nesting models](#nesting-models)).
2. The `model.update` or `model.updateDecorator` methods included in a FFC's model wrapper must be used to perform local model value updates.

:::tip
In general, an FFC's local model value updates should always be performed with `model.update` or `model.updateDecorator` to ensure proper behavior.
:::

The `model.update` method receives as a single argument a value to assign to the model's value. However, sometimes multiple model-value assignments (or write operations) need to be performed consecutively. When this is the case, `model.update` may receive instead a callback function where (synchronous) model value updates can be normally performed and which is immediately invoked. Similarly, the `model.updateDecorator` method receives a callback where the model value can be normally updated; but instead of immediately executing the callback, a new function that wraps the callback is created.

```js
model.update(newValue)
model.update(() => {
	model.value = newValue
})
const eventHandler = model.updateDecorator(event => {
	model.value = event.target.value
})
```

Then, if these requisites are satisfied, the `model.onInternalUpdate` and `model.onExternalUpdate` methods included in model wrappers can be used to handle internal and external model value updates, respectively. Both of these methods register callbacks to be executed when a corresponding model update is detected. They accept two parameters: the callback function and an `options` object. The configuration options they have in common are `immediate`, `once`, and `flush`, which all share the same possible values and behavior as the corresponding watcher options. Both methods return a function to unregister the provided callback. On the other hand, the arguments received by their registered callbacks are different, and `model.onExternalUpdate` accepts an additional configuration option.

#### `model.onInternalUpdate`

Callbacks registered with `model.onInternalUpdate` receive two arguments: the new and old model values.

```js
model.onInternalUpdate((newModelValue, oldModelValue) => {
	/* ... */
})
```

#### `model.onExternalUpdate`

Callbacks registered with `model.onExternalUpdate` receive four arguments, the first two being the new and old model values. Since `onExternalUpdate` is implemented with `watch`, the `onCleanup` function is passed as the fourth argument. An additional `isProgrammatic` boolean is passed as the third argument; it indicates whether the model value update was performed *programmatically*.

Conceptually, a model value update is considered programmatic if it is performed outside an FFC tree, which corresponds to the scope where an FFC is being consumed rather than implemented. Comparatively, model value updates performed anywhere inside an FFC tree may be considered *interactive* in the sense that they (directly or indirectly) originate from user interaction with the rendered template of FFCs.

Once again, the beforementioned requirements must be fulfilled in order for model value updates to be properly identified as programmatic. In practice, model value updates not performed with `model.update` or `model.updateDecorator` will be perceived as programmatic.

```js
model.onExternalUpdate((newModelValue, oldModelValue, isProgrammatic) => {
	/* ... */
})
```

Additionally, `onExternalUpdate` accepts an `onMounted` boolean configuration option. When set to true, the callback's registration and immediate execution are deferred until the FFC is mounted.

### Including exposed data

Similar to regular models, model wrappers provided to a child FFC may include `exposed` and `elements` properties to consume the child FFC's exposed data and elements, respectively (see [`model.exposed`](/composables/useModel#model-exposed)). Although these properties are absent by default, the `useDefineModel`'s `includeExposed` and `includeElements` boolean options can be used to include corresponding `exposed` and `elements` objects into a model wrapper.

```vue
<script setup>
defineProps(/* ... */)
const model = useDefineModel({
	includeExposed: true,
	includeElements: true
})
onMounted(() => {
	// Nested's exposed data and elements are made available
	// through model.exposed and model.elements, respectively.
    console.log(model.exposed.someProperty)
    console.log(model.elements.someHTMLElement)
})
</script>

<template>
	<Nested :model-value="model"/>
</template>
```

:::tip
A model wrapper should only set `includeExposed` or `includeElements` to `true` if it will be provided to a nested FFC whose exposed data or elements are required.
:::

### Capturing exposed data

In order to support Vergil's API to consume component exposed data (see [`useExposed`](/composables/useExposed#description)), components may expose their data by implementing the [`useDefineExposed`](/composables/useDefineExposed) and [`useDefineElements`](/composables/useDefineElements) composables. These composables expect for a component to receive, via a model or `exposed` and `elements` props, corresponding `exposed` and `elements` objects through which the component's exposed data and elements are respectively made available.

Sometimes, however, an FFC may not expose data of its own, but directly exposes the data of a child FFC instead. For this purpose, a model wrapper may *capture* its FFC's received `exposed` and `elements` objects to "redirect" them to a child FFC, which in turn exposes its data into the captured objects.

A model wrapper can capture `exposed` and `elements` objects by setting the `useDefineModel`'s `captureExposed` and `captureElements` options to `true`. In practice, captured objects are simply attached to corresponding model wrapper's `exposed` and `elements` properties. Thus, a model wrapper may normally access captured objects and be provided to a child FFC.

```vue
<script setup>
defineProps(/* ... */)
const model = useDefineModel({
	captureExposed: true,
	captureElements: true
})
</script>

<template>
	<!--
	Nested's exposed data and elements are made available
	to captured `exposed` and `elements` objects.
	-->
	<Nested :model-value="model"/>
</template>
```

:::tip
When `captureExposed` or `captureElements` are set to `true`, a model wrapper *attempts* to capture the corresponding objects provided to its FFC; but if none are received, the fallback values used for the model wrapper's `exposed` and `elements` properties are respectively determined by the `includeExposed` and `includeElements`  options: If an *`includeX`* option is set to `true`, the corresponding fallback value is an internally created `exposed` or `elements` object, and `null` otherwise.

## Definition

```ts
function useDefineModel<T>(options?: DefineModelOptions): ModelWrapper<T>

interface DefineModelOptions {
	isCollection?: boolean;
	includeExposed?: boolean;
	captureExposed?: boolean;
	includeElements?: boolean;
	captureElements?: boolean;
}

type ModelWrapper<T> = {
	updateDecorator<F extends Function>(fn: F): F;
	update(v: unknown): void;
	onExternalUpdate(
		callback: ExternalModelUpdateCallback,
		options?: Omit<WatchOptions, 'deep'> & { onMounted?: boolean }
	): () => void;
	onInternalUpdate(
		callback: InternalModelUpdateCallback,
		options?: Omit<WatchOptions, 'deep'>
	): () => void;
	exposed: Exposed | null | undefined;
	elements: Elements | null | undefined;
	triggerIfShallow(): void;
	handleValidation(eager?: boolean): void;
	useDebouncedValidation(minWait: number, options?: { eager?: boolean }): (eager?: boolean) => void;
} & Omit<Model<T>, 'exposed' | 'elements'>

type InternalModelUpdateCallback<T> = (
	value: T,
	oldValue: T | undefined
) => any;

type ExternalModelUpdateCallback<T> = (
	value: T,
	oldValue: T | undefined,
	isProgrammatic: boolean,
	onCleanup: OnCleanup
) => any;
```

#### Parameters

- **options**:
	- **`isCollection`**: Whether the model value may be a collection-like data type (e.g., array, object). Defaults to `false`.
	- **`includeExposed`/`includeElements`**: Whether to include into the model wrapper an `exposed`/`elements` object. Defaults to `false`.
	- **`captureExposed`/`captureElements`**: Whether to attach into the model wrapper the `exposed`/`elements` object provided to its associated component (either through a model or the `exposed`/`elements` prop). Defaults to `false`.

#### Return value

An extendedRef object. Additional included methods are:

- `onInternalUpdate`
- `onExternalUpdate`
- `update`
- `updateDecorator`
- `triggerIfShallow`: Triggers the underlying model's `ref` object if shallow. This utility method helps implement components that support models with underlying shallow refs.
	```js
	model.triggerIfShallow()
	// same as
	if (isShallow(model.ref)) {
		triggerRef(model.ref)
	}
	```
- `handleValidation`: Validates its associated *validation target* if it has errors. The validation target is the model if it does not belong to a [ModelGroup](/functions/modelgroup) or its ModelGroup ancestors do not have [group validators](/functions/modelgroup#model-group-validation). Otherwise, the validation target is the model's eldest ModelGroup ancestor with a group validator. In addition, `handleValidation` accepts a single boolean `eager` parameter that defaults to `false`; when set to `true`, the validation target is validated even if it does not have errors. The following is an approximation of this method's implementation.
	```js
	handleValidation = (eager = false) => {
		if (eager || validationTarget.error) validationTarget.validate()
	}
	```
	This utility method helps to handle a component's model validation in response to component interaction.
- `useDebouncedValidation`: Creates a method similar to `handleValidation`, but where the validation target's validation is debounced. Receives two parameters, `minWait` and `options`, corresponding to those of the [`debounce`](/functions/utilities#debounce) function. Additionally, the created debounced function's `cancel` method is automatically called when the model's value is validated (with `model.validate`) or model errors are cleared (with `model.clear`).
	```js
	const handleDebouncedValidation = model.useDebouncedValidation(300)
	handleDebouncedValidation() // debounced validation
	```
