    (this: unknown, ...args: unknown[]): void;
    cancel: () => void;
}

function useDebounce(
    fn: Function,
    minWait: MaybeRefOrGetter<number>,
    options?: {
        eager?: MaybeRefOrGetter<boolean>;
    }
): Debounced
```

#### Parameters

- **`fn`** â€” Function to debounce.
- **`minWait`** â€” Time in milliseconds to wait before executing `fn` since the debounced function's last call.
- `options`
    - **`eager`** â€” When set to `true`, `fn` is executed as soon as the debounced function is called *if* `fn` is not scheduled and `minWait` milliseconds have elapsed since `fn`'s last execution (or `fn` has not been executed). Defaults to `false`.

#### Return value

Debounced function with `cancel` method to cancel scheduled `fn` execution.
